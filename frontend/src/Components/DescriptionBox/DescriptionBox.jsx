        <p>An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest benefits of e-commerce is that you can sell your products and services to anyone, from anywhere. As long as a customer has access to your website, they can purchase from it, even if theyâ€™re on the other side of the world.</p>
